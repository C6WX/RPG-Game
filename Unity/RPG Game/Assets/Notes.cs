// make the game like an idle fighting game where the player rolls a dice to determine the damage they deal
// the player and enemy will have health and damage
// as the player kills enemies, they will gain xp and when they level up it will increase their stats
// the luck  will be equal to the sides on the dice that is rolled, the higher the level, the lower the luck value will be meaning there is less sides on the dice so less numbers meaning less numbers will lower attack value
// enemies will have a difficulty
